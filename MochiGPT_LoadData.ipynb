Performance can vary by orders of magnitude, depending on how the sort is written. In this paper, we examine Perl´s sort function in depth and describe how to use it with simple and complex data. Next we analyze and compare several well-known Perl sorting optimizations (including the Orcish Maneuver and the Schwartzian Transform). We then show how to improve their performance significantly, by packing multiple sortkeys into a single string. Finally, we present a fresh approach, using the sort function with packed sortkeys and without a sortsub. This provides much better performance than any of the other methods, and is easy to implement directly or by using a new module we created, Sort::Records. NOTE: Sort::Records died during development but five years later, Sort::Maker was released and does all that was promised and more. Find it on CPAN', '', 'What is sorting and why do we use it?', '', 'Sorting is the rearrangement of a list into an order defined by a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence of sortkeys, where each sortkey is a single-valued function of the corresponding element of the list. (We will use the term sortkeys to avoid confusion with the keys of a hash.) Sorting is used to reorder a list into a sequence suitable for further processing or searching. In many cases the sorted output is intended for people to read; sorting makes it much easier to understand the data and to find a desired datum. Sorting is used in many types of programs and on all kinds of data. It is such a common, resource-consuming operation that sorting algorithms and the creation of optimal implementations comprise an important branch of computer science. This paper is about creating optimal sorts using Perl. We start with a brief overview of sorting, including basic algorithm theory and notation, some well-known sorting algorithms and their efficiencies, sortkey processing, and sorting outside of Perl. Next we will describe Perl´s sort function [1] and basic ways to use it. Then we cover handling complex sortkeys, which raises the question of how to optimize their processing. Finally we introduce a relatively new method, which moves all the sortkey processing out of the sort function, and which produces the most efficient Perl sort. A new module is also described, which implements this sorting technique and which has powerful support for sortkey extraction (the processing of the input data to produce the sortkeys.', '', 'Algorithm and sorting theory', '', 'A complete discussion of algorithm and sorting theory is beyond the scope of this paper. This section will cover just enough theory and terminology to explain the methods that we use to compare sort techniques. The complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the resources needed to execute the algorithm -- typically there is a critical operation that needs to be executed many times. Part of algorithm theory is figuring out which operation is the limiting factor, and then formulating a function that describes the number of times the operation is executed. This complexity function is commonly written with the big-O notation -- O(f(N)) -- where `O´ is read as `order of´ and `f(N)´ is some function of N, the size of the input data set. O(f(N)) comparisons have some unusual properties. The actual size of N is usually irrelevant to the correct execution of an algorithm, but its influence on the behavior of f(N) is critical. If an algorithm´s order is O(N*logN + N), when N is large enough the effect of the N on the function´s value is negligible compared to the N*logN expression. So that algorithm´s order is just O(N*logN). In many cases the calculated order function for an algorithm is a polynomial of N, but you see only the term with the highest power, and no coefficient is shown. Similarly, if two algorithms have the same order but one does more work for each operation, they are still equivalent in order space, even though there may be a substantial difference in real-world speeds. That last point is crucial in the techniques we will show to optimize Perl sorts, all of which have the same big-O function, O(N*logN). Here are some well-known algorithms and their order functions (adapted from [2]):', '', 'Notation Name Example O(1) constant array or hash index O(logN) logarithmic binary search O(N) linear string comparison O(N*logN) n log n advanced sort O(N**2) quadratic simple sort O(N**3) cubic matrix multiplication O(2**N) exponential set partitioning', '', 'Sorting´s critical operation is determining in which order to put pairs of elements of the data. The comparison can be as simple as finding whether two numbers are equal or which is greater than the other (or doing similar operations on strings), or it can be quite complex. Simple sorting algorithms (bubble or insertion sorts) compare each element to each of the others repeatedly, so their complexity is O(N**N). Even with the triangle optimization ($x is equal to $x, and $x compared to $y is the negative of $y compared to $x), which reduces the function to O((N * (N-1))/2), the complexity is still O(N**N), as explained above. But these algorithms have their uses. When N is very small, they can actually be faster than the other methods, because the O(1) and O(N) overhead of the advanced sorts may outweigh the O(N**2) behavior of the simple sorts. \"Fancy algorithms are slow when N is small, and N is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants.\" [3] The really important cases, which are worth care in the coding, occur when N is large. Advanced sorting methods repeatedly partition the records to be sorted into smaller sets, to reduce the total number of comparisons needed. Their complexity is O(N*logN), which can be much less than O(N**2) for sufficiently large values of N. These algorithms include `tree sort´, `shell sort´, and `quicksort´. [4] Some specialized sort algorithms (such as `radix sort´) work by comparing pieces of numeric sortkeys, and can achieve linear complexity (O(N)) [5]. These methods are not general-purpose, so we will not address them further. One property of sort algorithms is whether they are stable. A stable sort preserves the order in the sorted data of two elements that compare equal. Some sorting problems require stability. The simple sorting algorithms are generally stable; the advanced ones are not. We will show how to make Perl´s advanced sort behave stably if required. An important sorting variation is when the original data elements can´t conveniently be moved around by the sort algorithm´s shuffling. So instead of sorting the elements directly, you sort their index numbers. You then use the sorted indexes to create a list of sorted elements. Some sort operators in other languages (APL comes to mind) simply return sorted indexes, and it is up to the programmer to use them correctly. We will show how to create an efficient Perl index sort and where it is useful.', '', 'Sortkeys', '', 'If you are sorting a set of scalar-valued elements where the comparison looks at the entire element, the sortkey is simply the entire element. More generally, the sortkey is based on some properties that are functions of all or part of the element. Such subkeys may be extracted from internal properties of parts of the element (fields) or derived from external properties of the element (such as the modification date of a file named by the element, which is quite expensive to retrieve from the file system). To avoid repeated computation of the sortkeys, the sort process has to retain the association between records and their extracted or derived sortkeys. Sorting theory and algorithms usually ignore the cost of this association, as it is typically a constant factor of the comparison operation. But as we will see later, in the real world, removing that overhead or reducing it from O(N*logN) to O(N) is very valuable, especially as N grows. Complex sortkeys can add tremendously to the overhead of each comparison. This occurs where the records have to be sorted by primary, secondary, and lower-order subkeys. This is also known as doing a subsort on the lower keys. Extracting and comparing complex sortkeys can be costly and error-prone. No general-purpose implementation of a sort algorithm can efficiently support extracting and comparing different types of sortkeys. Therefore, most sort implementations provide a simple interface to call a sortsub -- a custom comparison subroutine which is passed two operands. These operands can be the records themselves, or references to or indexes of complex records. The comparison returns a negative, zero, or positive value, depending on the ordering of the sortkeys of the two records. The programmer is responsible for any preprocessing of the records to generate the sortkeys and any postprocessing to retrieve the sorted data. The generic sort function only manages the comparisons and shuffles the operands into sorted order. As Perl´s sort function is O(N*logN), efficiency must come from extracting and comparing the sortkeys using the least amount of work. Much of this paper will be about methods to make sortkey extraction and comparison as efficient as possible.', '', 'External sorting', '', 'Every popular commercial operating system offers a sort utility. Unix/POSIX flavors typically have a sort command which is fast and fairly flexible with regard to sortkey extraction from text files. In some cases, the Unix/POSIX sort command may be easier to code and more efficient than using the Perl sort function. Several vendors sell highly optimized commercial sort packages that have received decades of attention and can handle massive amounts of data. But they are very expensive and not suitable for use inside a Perl program. All of these are capable of dealing efficiently with very large amounts of data, using external media such as disk or tape files for intermediate storage when needed. In contrast, the Perl sort function requires that the entire list of operands be in (real or -- much more expensively -- virtual) memory at the same time. So Perl is not the appropriate tool to use for huge sorts (where huge is defined by your system´s memory limits), which we shall not consider further.', '', 'Internal sorting', '', 'The Perl sort function uses an implementation of the quicksort algorithm that is similar to (but more robust than) the qsort function in the ANSI/ISO Standard C Library [6]. In the simplest use, the Perl sort function requires no sortsub:', '', '@out = sort @in;', '', 'This default sorts the data in ascending lexicographic order, using the fast C memcmp function as the comparison operation. If a locale is specified, it substitutes the more complicated and somewhat slower C strcoll function. If you want any kind of ordering other than this, you must provide a custom comparison sortsub. The sortsub can be specified either as a code block, the name of a subroutine, or a typeglob that refers to a subroutine (a coderef). In Perl 5.6, a scalar variable that contains a coderef can also be used to specify the sortsub. In order to optimize the calling of the sortsub, Perl bypasses the usual passing of arguments via @_, using instead a more efficient special-purpose method. Within the sortsub, the special global package variables $a and $b are aliases for the two operands being compared. The sortsub must return a number less than 0, equal to 0, or greater than 0, depending on the result of comparing the sortkeys of $a and $b. The special variables $a and $b should never be used to change the values of any input data, as this may break the sort algorithm. Even the simplest custom sort in Perl will be less efficient than using the default comparison. The default sort runs entirely in C code in the perl core, but any sortsub must execute Perl code. A well-known optimization is to minimize the amount of Perl code executing and to try to stay inside the perl core as much as possible. Later we will see various optimization techniques that will reduce the amount of Perl code executed. The primary goal of this paper is to perform all sorts using the default comparison.

More typically, the sortkey is based on some property that is a function of all or part of each datum. Several individual subkeys may be combined into a single sortkey or may be compared in pairs individually. A complex string may be divided into fields, some of which may serve as subkeys. For example, the Unix/POSIX sort command provides built-in support for collation based on one or more fields of the input; the Perl sort function does not, and the programmer must provide it. One CPAN module focuses on fielded sorts [7]. If your data are records which are complex strings or references to arrays or hashes, you have to perform comparisons on selected parts of the records. This is called record sorting. (Fielded sorts are a subset of record sorts.) In the code examples that follow, KEY() is meant to be substituted with some Perl code that performs sortkey extraction. It is best that it not be an actual subroutine call, because subroutine calls within sortsubs can be expensive. Calls to built-in Perl functions (such as the calls to lc in the example above) are like Perl operators, thus relatively less expensive. When sorting string records, $a and $b are set to those strings, so to extract the sortkeys you generally perform various string operations on the records. Functions commonly used for this include split, substr, unpack, and m//. Here is one example, sorting a list of password-file lines by user name using split. The fields are separated by colons, and the user name is the first field.', '', '@out = sort {', '', \"(split ':', $a, 2)[0] cmp\", '', \"(split ':', $b, 2)[0]\", '', '} @pw_lines;', '', 'Multi-subkey sorts', '', 'In some cases you need to sort records by a primary subkey, then for all the records with the same primary subkey value, you need to sort by a secondary subkey. One horribly inefficient way to do this is to sort first by the primary subkey, then get all the records with a given subkey and sort them by the secondary subkey. The standard method is to do a multi-key sort. This entails extracting a subkey for each field, and comparing paired subkeys in priority order. So if two records with the same primary subkey are compared, they will actually be compared based on the secondary subkey. Sorting on more than two subkeys is done by extending the logic. Perl has a very nice feature which makes multi-key sorts easy to write. The || (short-circuit or) operator returns the actual value of the first logically true operand it sees. So if you use || to concatenate a set of key comparisons, the first comparison is the primary subkey. If a pair of primary subkeys compare equal, the sortsub´s return value will be the result of the secondary subkey comparison. An example will illustrate this `ladder´ of comparisons better than more text. Here is a three-subkey sort:', '', '@out = sort {', '']\n"

RELATED Gallery: Missing Aruba teen \\x95 Texas team to aid search \\x95 Publicity a concern for tourism \\x95 Was race a factor in arrests? \\x95 Interactive: Safety tips for travelers YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Aruba Alabama Crime, Law and Justice or or Create Your Own ORANJESTAD, Aruba (CNN) -- An Aruban judge, the father of a 17-year-old suspect in the disappearance of an Alabama teenager, also has been arrested in the case, the island\\'s police commissioner said Thursday. Prosecutors decided to keep Paul Van Der Sloot, 53, in custody for questioning for 48 hours, Aruba Police Commissioner Jan Van Der Straten said. Under Aruban law, if there is reasonable suspicion, the prosecutor\\'s office can order a suspect held as long as another 48 hours. After that, a judge\\'s decision is required to keep a suspect in jail. The legal system in Aruba, an autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, is based partly on Dutch civil law. The father was arrested at about 2 p.m. on suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, an 18-year-old from suburban Birmingham, Alabama, said prosecution spokeswoman Mariaine Croes. \"At this point he\\'s a suspect,\" Croes said. \"There\\'s a reasonable suspicion that he knows something and is involved in the disappearance of Ms. Holloway.\" Police questioned him over the weekend in connection with the case. A law enforcement source close to the investigation said at the time that the judge was interviewed as a witness. He spent about five hours in the police station Saturday for questioning and was brought in again on Sunday while his wife, Anita, visited their 17-year-old son, Joran. Last week, an Aruban judge ruled that Paul Van Der Sloot could not visit his son in jail. Earlier, authorities had searched Van Der Sloot\\'s home, seizing two cars and removing bagfuls of evidence. Anita Van Der Sloot said Thursday her husband\\'s arrest is \"ridiculous.\" \"It hurts because my husband gave 15 years of his integrity to this island, and that this could happen is so bizarre.\" \"I don\\'t understand, and I know a lot of people don\\'t understand, what\\'s going on,\" she said. \"I\\'m very angry, but I will hold up.\" \"I have to because I believe in my husband, I believe in my son,\" she said. \"It will all will be fine.\" She said she met with Joran for about 40 minutes Thursday before receiving word that police were at her home to arrest her husband. Her son is \"doing fine,\" she said. \"I know he\\'s innocent, and he knows he\\'s innocent.\" Family \\'relieved\\' Natalee Holloway\\'s aunt, Marcia Twitty, said her family was \"very relieved\" by the judge\\'s arrest. \"Maybe we can get somewhere and finally get these answers that they so desperately, desperately want,\" she told CNN from Alabama. The missing girl\\'s father, David Holloway, said the arrest \"just adds that additional piece to the puzzle. \"How big is the puzzle? I don\\'t know, but the pieces are falling into place and falling into place very quickly,\" he told CNN affiliate WBRC. Natalee\\'s mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, said Wednesday she\\'s sure the four young men in custody -- but not formally charged in the case -- have more information to divulge. \"I have no doubt that they know what and who and where and when and why and how. I have no doubt,\" Twitty said on NBC\\'s \"Today Show.\" \"There are some other individuals, though, that need to be pursued,\" she added. Twitty told CNN she met Tuesday with the parents of Joran Van Der Sloot. He\\'s one of the last people reported to have seen Holloway. She said the Van Der Sloots invited her into their home when she was handing out prayer cards in their neighborhood. Twitty refused to give details about their 90-minute discussion. \"I think I walked away with the confirmation that we still have some individuals that we need to pursue,\" she said. Holloway, an honors student from the Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook, disappeared May 30 after she left a nightclub with Joran Van Der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe, ages 21 and 18 respectively, authorities said. She was in Aruba, a small Caribbean island of 72,000 residents just north of Venezuela, with about 100 classmates to celebrate their recent graduation. The three men and a fourth suspect, 26-year-old disc jockey Steve Croes, face accusations of murder and kidnapping leading to murder. Twitty says she has seen \"no evidence whatsoever\" that her daughter is dead. Defense attorneys for Van Der Sloot and the Kalpoes have said their clients maintain their innocence. Marcia Twitty said that after meeting with the Van Der Sloots, the missing girl\\'s mother told her: \"\\'I still feel like that dad knows something about where Natalee is.\\'\" \"She\\'s in very close contact with officials, both Aruban and FBI,\" she said. \"They talk daily.\" Satish Kalpoe to mom: \\'We didn\\'t do anything\\' The mother of the Kalpoes said Thursday that one son had admitted he and his brother made up a cover story to protect Joran Van Der Sloot. Nadira Ramirez told CNN she was permitted to visit son Satish Kalpoe at Aruba\\'s prison within the past week. She stressed that the teen told her their story was not planned ahead of Holloway\\'s disappearance, and she had no advance knowledge of it. Initially, Ramirez said, her sons had told her and police they dropped Holloway off at the Holiday Inn, where she was staying. But Satish Kalpoe told his mother later that was a lie aimed at protecting Van Der Sloot. In fact, he told his mother, he and his brother had dropped Holloway and Van Der Sloot off at the beach by the Marriott hotel, about a mile from the Holiday Inn. Ramirez\\'s account echoes comments made by one of two security guards who were arrested June 5 in connection with the case and released June 13. The guards, Abraham Jones, 28, and Mickey John, 30, were never charged. After his release, John said Deepak Kalpoe confided to him while they were in jail together that he had lied to police. (CNN Access) Ramirez tearfully said her son insisted he and his brother were innocent. \"\\'We didn\\'t do anything. We will be out from here. Don\\'t cry,\\'\" she said he told her. \"I asked him, \\'Satish, are you sure you guys didn\\'t do anything?\\'\" she said. She said he responded: \"\\'No, mama. We gave that girl and Joran a lift.\\' \"They don\\'t even know Natalee. They said she didn\\'t even introduce herself to them,\" she said. \"They don\\'t know anything else about that.\" Although she has been suffering and unable to eat since her sons\\' arrest, Ramirez said she remains confident they will be cleared. She described her family as a close and traditional Hindu group and said both sons are \"good boys.\" Satish does not drink, she said, and while Deepak drinks occasionally, neither youth takes drugs.

At the same time, direc.tor makes an XmlHTTPRequest to http://del.icio.us/api/posts/all to get the XML listing of the user's bookmarks, which is persisted through the lifetime of the direc.tor page.

Because these components are compiled binaries, their methods are orders of magnitude faster than an equivalent implementation in intepreted Javascript. del.icio.us direc.tor offloads all of the heavy lifting and a majority of the HTML generation to the XSLT processor to provide a responsive user interface.
